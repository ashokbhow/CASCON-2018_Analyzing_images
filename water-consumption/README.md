# How to train the water-consumption model

## Training files
- `sf-belloday.zip`
- `sf-bellonight.zip`
- `sf-donkeyday.zip`
- `sf-donkeynight.zip`
- `sf-ponyday.zip`
- `sf-ponynight.zip`
- `sf-shortyday.zip`

The sample notebooks and apps expect the classes to be named the same as the training files, but without the `'sf-'` prefix and without the `.zip` extension:
- belloday
- bellonight
- donkeyday
- donkeynight
- ponyday
- ponynight
- shortyday
- shortynight

# Demo of water-consumption sample app
**Note:** If you intend to build the sample app and run it for yourself, vewing the demo ruins the surprise!  But if you do not intend to build the app yourself, and are just curious about what it's like.. enjoy:
